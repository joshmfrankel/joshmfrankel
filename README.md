# Hi, I'm Josh <br> A Developer with a passion for standards and beautiful code

I am a passionate developer who thrives on the challenge of keeping up with the ever changing web. My experience includes implementing mobile first designs as well as converting existing websites into responsive layouts. I have spent the last ten+ years coding in a variety of languages, completing server and database tasks, and working as part of a results-focused team. I take pride in making sure everything I develop is always up to web standards.

I am obsessed with mastering the newest programming techniques and skills. You can find me constantly pouring over the latest articles and tutorials. When I'm not reading up on web development, I usually am writing about it in my programming blog.
